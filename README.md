<pre>This library is for using MAX5481â€“MAX5484 chips on arduino platform. These chips are 10-Bit, Nonvolatile, Linear-Taper Digital
Potentiometers.

This labrary is very easy to use. First a new instance has to be defined, and the available functions are as follows:-
      1.) setPOT(value) - value defines the new wiper position (range 0 - 1023).
      2.) toNV()  - This function is to store the current wiper position in the non-volatile register.
      3.) fromNV()  - This function is to update the wiper position from the non-volatile register.</pre>
